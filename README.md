# Patzer Bot

*BOT COMMANDS DOWN DUE TO SLASH COMMAND IMPLEMENTATION*

October 2020 - July 2021

Previously, a bot made to both advertise events/tournaments between servers and chess commands. Later, made into a chess only bot.

A Discord verified chess bot that displays and computes useful information from Chess.com and Lichess.org, made back in 2020.
